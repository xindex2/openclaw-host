# Bot Subdomains is harder with Caddy on host without docker labels...
# Since users are running on the HOST, they will bind to random ports?
# We will need a wildlycard proxy or the backend must update Caddy config via API?
# For simplicity in this "PM2 Mode", bots run on the host IP but different ports? 
# OR we wildcard proxy to specific ports if we track them?

# Solution: We will use a wildcard for subdomains and let Caddy route?
# No, Caddy normally needs to know the upstream port.
# Since we are abandoning Docker logic (Traefik), we lose dynamic routing easily.
#
# ALTERNATIVE: Backend writes a Caddy JSON config updates.
# FOR NOW: Let's assume the user just wants the Dashboard working. 
# Terminal access happens via the main Dashboard socket.
# Public access to the BOT itself... is tricky without Traefik.
# We will skip public bot HTTP access in this first PM2 pass unless requested.
